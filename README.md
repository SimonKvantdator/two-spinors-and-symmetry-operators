# Git repo for "Two-spinors and Symmetry Operators: An Investigation into the Existence of Symmetry Operators for the Massive Dirac"

This is a git repo for my Master's thesis.
It contains the Mathematica code that was used for producing the results of my thesis.

TODO: link to the thesis when it gets published online.
